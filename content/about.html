<h1>About the owner</h1>
<p>
This site (woolie.co.uk) has been my internet dumping-ground since 2005. I enjoy tinkering with internet technologies, particularly focussing on scalability and performance.

Feel free to email me directly using 'woolie' at this domain (is email address
scraping still a thing?). I also lurk in other places, but am shockingly poor
at keeping them updated:

<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>
    There were some specific reasons for creating this most recent version of woolie.co.uk:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Learning CSS flexbox</strong>. I hadn't made a website without using the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework since 2013. Back then, the grid system that Bootstrap provided was exceptionally handy - floats and tables were the only tools available. In the meantime, flexbox had turned up in CSS and I knew nothing about it!</li>
        <li><strong>Using SVGs</strong>. Back in 2008, decent SVG support across browsers was shonky. Being able to include and resize SVGs properly is a big advantage.</li>
        <li><strong>Self hosting web fonts</strong>. As much as I like the convenience of Google Web Fonts, the extra external dependency always bugged me. With WOFF/WOFF2 now widely supported, the cross-browser compatibility that Google Web Fonts provided (based on User-Agent) isn't as required. Although I haven't measured whether it actually makes a difference, including a preload link in the head might reduce the <abbr title="Flash of Invisible Text">FOIT</abbr>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

If you're as sad as me, you like probing the components used to generate and
host websites. For this site, both the source code and CloudFormation templates
are available to <a href="https://github.com/AWooldrige/woolie.co.uk">view on
GitHub</a>. In summary:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Generated using <a href="https://nanoc.ws/">Nanoc</a></strong>. Even though Nanoc requires wrangling Ruby, it's worth the pain of Stack Overflow Driven Development. Nanoc is a superb unopinionated static site generator.</li>
    <li><strong>Hosted on Amazon Web Services</strong>. No complicated setup, just S3, fronted by CloudFront with an ACM certificate. I have no particular affection for AWS, but for now it's cheap as chips and I don't have to worry about <abbr title="High Availability">HA</abbr>.</li>
    <li><strong>Uploaded using <a href="https://github.com/AWooldrige/s3sup">s3sup</a></strong>. This open source S3 static website uploader is a side project of mine. You should take a look at the features if you host a static site on S3.</li>
</ul>
