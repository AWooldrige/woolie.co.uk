<p class="lead-spacer">I'm Alistair, and woolie.co.uk has been my internet dumping-ground since 2005. To introduce myself in three lines, I:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enjoy tinkering with many internet technologies.</li>
    <li>Currently work at the BBC. It's best practice that I inform you that all views or opinions expressed on this site are completely my own and are not those of my employer.</li>
    <li>Am a casual flyer of flying fixed wing microlights.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Feel free to email me directly using 'woolie' @ the same domain as this site.</p>
<p>Although I lurk in places such as <a href="https://twitter.com/AWooldrige" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, I'm very poor at checking them regularly.</p>
