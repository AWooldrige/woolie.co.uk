<h1>About the owner</h1>
<p>
    This site (woolie.co.uk) has been my internet dumping-ground since 2005. To introduce myself in three lines, I:
    <ul>
        <li>Enjoy tinkering with many internet technologies, particularly around scalability and performance.</li>
        <li>Am curious about all things aviation and fly a microlight from Hunsdon airfield.</li>
        <li>Currently work at the BBC. Which also means it's best practice to mention that all views and opinions expressed on this site are my own and are not those of my employer. Other disclaimers are available.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>Feel free to email me directly using 'woolie' @ the same domain as this site.</p>
<p>I also lurk in other places, but am often quite poor at keeping them updated:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/awooldrige">awooldrige on LinkedIn</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/AWooldrige">@AWooldrige on Twitter</a></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>
The most recent design of the site spun out of my desire to create a website without using Bootstrap for the first time in 6 years - forcing me to learn this flexbox thing that had appeared in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
I plan to write an article about the configuration and optimisation of the site, but for now here are the key parts:
<ul>
    <li>Generated using <a href="https://nanoc.ws/">Nanoc</a>. Even though I have to use extensive Stack Overflow Driven Development to wrangle the Ruby, it's worth it for this well designed static site generator.</p>
    <li>Hosted on Amazon S3, fronted by CloudFront with an ACM certificate.</li>
    <li>Uploaded using <a href="https://github.com/AWooldrige/s3sup">s3sup</a>, S3 static website uploader. A side project of mine.</li>
</ul>
</p>
