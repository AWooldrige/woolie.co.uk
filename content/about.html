<p class="lead-spacer">
    This site (woolie.co.uk) has been my internet dumping-ground since 2005. To introduce myself in three lines, I:
    <ul>
        <li>Enjoy tinkering with many internet technologies, particularly around scalability and performance.</li>
        <li>Am curious about all things aviation and fly a microlight from Hunsdon airfield.</li>
        <li>Currently work at the BBC. Which also means it's best practice to mention that all views and opinions expressed on this site are my own and are not those of my employer. Other disclaimers are available.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Feel free to email me directly using 'woolie' @ the same domain as this site.</p>
<p>I also lurk in other places, but am often quite poor at keeping them updated:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/awooldrige">awooldrige on LinkedIn</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/AWooldrige">@AWooldrige on Twitter</a></li>
    </ul>
</p>
