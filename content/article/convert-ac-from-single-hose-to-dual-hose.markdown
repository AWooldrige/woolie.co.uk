Single hose air conditioners (AC) should be banned. By design, they are
inefficient; they can blast cold air at a person sitting directly in front,
but will never be able to cool the rest of the room. Single hose ACs are bad
news for the environment, energy bills and your heatwave comfort!

The problem for UK residents is that single hose ACs are the only type of
portable model available to buy. Dual hose models or [window
units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning#Window_unit_and_packaged_terminal)
are not available, despite their drastically better cooling performance. But
what makes single hose ACs so bad?


## Background: Air conditioners are just refrigerators with fans
Most air conditioning systems work by exchanging heat from the inside air to
the outside air, using [vapor-compression
refrigeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor-compression_refrigeration).
All efficient designs (anything that's not a single hose) do this without ever
mixing the separate air masses or causing any pressure differential between the
outside and inside. It doesn't matter whether it's a split AC unit in a
commercial property, the AC in your car, or your kitchen refrigerator, they
follow this operating model:

    )
%>
</div>


Dual hose portable air conditioners follow the same principle, but incorporate
the outside unit into a single inside unit; instead using ducting hoses to draw
outside air over the condenser coils and back to the outside again. They are
more convenient as no permanent installation is required, but are marginally
less efficient due to heat loss through the hoses and the additional heat
generated from the compressor which is now inside the room that needs to be
cooled.

    )
%>
</div>


## What makes single hose ACs so bad?
Single hose models are the only type that violate this principle, which is why
they are so inefficient. Instead of using two hoses to keep the air masses
separate and drawing outside air to pass over the condenser coils, they ditch the
intake hose and just draw the *inside* air instead. Why? Probably because they're
cheaper to manufacture and easier for customers to install.

    )

But this design has a huge performance cost. With the inside air now being
forced to the outside through the exhaust hose, the inside is now always at a
lower pressure.  No room is perfectly sealed, so to equalise the pressure, hot
air from outside is continuously drawn through door frames and a multitude of
other tiny gaps in the room. This is why single hose units will never cool an
entire room, they are constantly fighting against hot air rushing back into the
room due to the negative pressure.

Don't believe me? Turn the AC on in a small room, use a good seal between the
exhaust hose and the window, then close all doors and feel around the gaps
between the door and the frame. You'll be able to feel the air rushing in to
the equalise the negative pressure in the room you're trying to cool.


## Solution: Convert the single hose AC to dual hose
Thankfully, many single hose ACs can easily be converted to dual hose systems.
Single hose systems are often designed with two separate intake ports just like
dual hose units, despite only needing one; presumably to reduce design and
manufacturing costs. By fashioning an adapter to duct the condenser intake port
so that it draws from the outside air, it will perform with the same efficiency
as a dual hose unit.

There are two requirements that a single hose air conditioning unit must meet
to make conversion possible:

 1. **There must be two separate air intake ports for the evaporator and
    condenser sides**.
    1. The unit likely meets this requirement if it has three separate air
       grilles in addition to the exhaust hose.
 2. **There must be an internal separation between the evaporator and condenser
    side air flows**. There are two ways to find this out:
    1. Find photos or designs from others that have explored the internals of
       your model.
    2. Open the unit up and investigate yourself. Do not do this unless you are
       confident about electrical and refridgerant safety and are prepared to
       invalidate the warranty of your machine.

To convert the unit from single host to dual hose:

 1. Source an additional air conditioning hose or equivalent.
 2. Identify which air grille on the unit is the condenser (hot coil) air
    intake.
 3. Create an adapter to duct this air grille into the additional air
    conditioning hose, so that it can be made to draw air from the outside.

## My conversion example
I purchased a "Challenge 5K Air Conditioning Unit" in 2019 for Â£289.99 from
Argos. Despite only being 5000 BTU, after conversion to dual hose it was able
to cool a medium sized room from 34 C outside temperatures down to 22 C in only
a couple of hours.

The conversion was performed in minutes, using items easily purchased at a
hardware shop or found around the house:

 1. A tumble drier hose.
 2. Discarded polystyrene packaging foam and cardboard.
 3. Spare foam strips that came along with the air conditioner to provide a
    better seal between the polystyrene and the unit.
 3. Plenty of duck tape.

This isn't an ideal set of materials, but works well enough to tide over for
the summer.

On the Challenge unit, the condenser air intake is the lower grille underneath
the exhaust hose port. After ducting this grille into the tumble drier hose,
this is the result. Not aesthetically pleasing, but very effective for the
three days of summer that the UK gets every year:

## Further tips for optimum efficiency

 * Purchase a window sealing unit designed for your type of window.
 * Keep the intake and exhaust hoses away from each other when outside of the
   window. Having them close to each other increases the change that the intake
   hose is drawing in freshly exhausted hot air. If stacking vertically, I like
   to keep the intake hose below the exhaust hose for this reason too, as hot
   air rises slightly.
 * Keep the length of the hoses short, to minimise losses back into the room.
   Move the unit as close to the window as possible.
