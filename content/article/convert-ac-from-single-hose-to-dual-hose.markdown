    Single hose air conditioners are ineffecient by design, but are the only
    portable type available to purchase in the UK. Convert them to dual hose
    for lower energy bills and drastically better cooling performance.
---
Single hose air conditioners (AC) should be banned. By design, they are
inefficient; they can blast cold air at a person sitting directly in front,
but will never be able to cool the rest of the room. Single hose ACs are bad
news for the environment, energy bills and your heatwave comfort!

The problem for UK residents is that single hose ACs are the only type of
portable model availabl. Dual hose models, [window
units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning#Window_unit_and_packaged_terminal)
or portable split units are not available, despite their superior
performance and efficiency.

But what makes single hose ACs so bad?


## Background: Air conditioners are refrigerators with fans
Most air conditioning systems work by exchanging heat from the inside air to
the outside air, using [vapor-compression
refrigeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor-compression_refrigeration).
All efficient designs (anything that's not a single hose) do this without ever
mixing the separate air masses or causing any pressure differential between the
outside and inside. It doesn't matter whether it's a split AC unit in a
commercial property, the AC in your car, or your kitchen refrigerator, they
follow this operating model:

        '/air-conditioning-system-type-split.svg',
        caption=true, half_width=true
    )
%>
</div>


Dual hose portable air conditioners are perfectly fine too, as they follow the
same principles. The only difference is that they incorporate the outside unit
into a single inside unit; instead using ducting hoses to draw outside air over
the condenser coils and back to the outside again. They are more convenient as
no permanent installation is required. They are marginally less efficient due
to heat loss through the hoses and the additional heat generated from the
compressor, which is now inside the room that needs to be cooled.

        caption=true, half_width=true
    )
%>
</div>


## What makes single hose ACs so bad?
Single hose models are the only type that violate this principle, which is why
they are so inefficient. Instead of using two hoses to keep the air masses
separate and drawing outside air to pass over the condenser coils, they ditch
the intake hose and just draw the *inside* air instead — destroying the working
principles of air conditioning. Why? Probably because it's easier to market and
sell the convenience of one hose rather than two. They forgot to mention in the
fine print that having only a single hose makes the machine close to useless.

<div class='gallery'>
<%=
    imageVerbatim(
        item.identifier.without_ext +
        '/air-conditioning-system-type-portable-single-hose.svg',
        caption=true, half_width=true
    )
%>
</div>


This single hose design has a huge performance cost. With the inside air now
being forced to the outside through the exhaust hose, the inside is now always
at a lower pressure.  No room is perfectly sealed, so to equalise the pressure,
hot air from outside is continuously drawn through door frames and a multitude
of other tiny gaps in the room. This is why single hose units will never cool
an entire room, they are constantly fighting against hot air rushing back into
the room due to the negative pressure.

Don't believe me? Turn the AC on in a small room, use a good seal between the
exhaust hose and the window, then close all doors and feel around the gaps
between the door and the frame. You'll be able to feel the air rushing in to
the equalise the negative pressure in the room you're trying to cool.

Don't believe me still? Leave your AC running for an hour, then come back in
the room. You'll be dissapointed. Walk round the edges of the room, it'll feel
barely cooler than when you left. Touch the walls, they'll be warm still. In
any other setting like an office, restaurant or car, you're used to the whole
room being cool, not just the tiny space directly in front of the air
conditioner.


## Solution: Convert the single hose AC to dual hose
Thankfully, many single hose ACs can easily be converted to dual hose systems.
Single hose systems are often designed with two separate intake ports just like
dual hose units, despite only needing one; it's like the engineeers knew that a
single hose was a bad idea so left in the ability for modification. By
fashioning an adapter to duct the condenser intake port so that it draws from
the outside air, it will perform with the same efficiency as a dual hose unit.

<div class='warning'>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>

<p>
I am not an expert on air conditioners, safety or anything related. You must be
aware that you are following instructions from some random person on the
internet that spent 20 minutes with cardboard, duck tape, trial, error and some
luck. If you choose to try it, you are doing so  completely at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
Some important warnings:
<ul>
   <li>
   <strong>Overheating risk:</strong> This modification might increase the risk
   of the unit overheating, especially if modified incorrectly. It is easier
   for the ducted intake hose to become blocked or the flow rate impaired,
       compared to a wide open grille that was present before. If you are
       ducting, make sure to not introduce any flow restrictions.
   </li>
   <li>
   <strong>Fire safety:</strong> Buy an additional fire alarm to have in the
   room with the AC. It is likely the room with AC will have the doors closed.
   If you fall asleep and the machine malfunctions, it'll take seconds for the
   smoke to fill the room.  With the doors closed, it's likely that you'll have
   already taken in too much smoke to wake up before it's able to reach the
   normal fire alarms outside the room you're in. You've spent a lot on an AC
   unit, spend a little extra to make sure you have a fire alarm in the same
   room as you.
   </li>
   <li>
   <strong>Warranty:</strong> It will almost certainly invalidate any manufacturer warranty.
   </li>
   <li>
   <strong>High temp materials:</strong> Materials used in the conversion must
   be able to withstand the same high temperatures as the exhaust hose, just in
   case they accidentally come in contact.
   </li>
</ul>
</p>

### Will this work with my AC? The flow block test...
Every AC unit is different, so there are no guarantees this modification will
work with every model. As a guide, there are two major requirements that an AC
unit must meet to make conversion possible:

 1. The machine must have internal separation and air tight seals between the
    evaporator and condenser air flows.
 1. There must be two separate air intake ports, one for the evaporator
    (cold out) and one for the condenser (hot exhaust) air flow.

There's a quick way to check whether both requirements 1 and 2 are met, and
also establish which intake needs ducting — I call it the flow block test:

 1. Attach the exhaust hose and turn the unit on. Keep the hose inside the room
    with you.
 2. Using a sturdy but flexible item in one hand, such as a magazine or
    cardboard cutout (something strong enough to not get sucked in),
    temporarily block one of the air intakes while the machine is running.
    Don't do this for more than 2 seconds at a time, because you might burn the
    AC fan motor out with the extra stress.
 3. Use your other hand to check the flow rate changes as you block the intake.
    To pass the test, when the intake is blocked, both:
    1. The air flow rate out the **exhaust hose** must significantly
       **reduce**, or stop entirely.
    2. There must be **no change** or reduction to the flow rate of air exiting
       the **cold air output** grille.
 4. If both of those flow rate tests pass, then congratulations the machine
    can be converted, and you've just found the intake that needs ducting to
    the outside with an extra hose.

An additional minor requirement is that thermostat temperature probe must be on
the evaporator (cold) side air intake/flow also. This usually looks like a
small plumb bob dangling in front of the evaporator (cold) coil fins.  The
trouble comes if the probe is located in the condenser (hot) side air intake,
because once the intake is ducted it will no longer measure the room
temperature, it'll measure the outside air temperature. This means that the
unit can never tell when the room has reached the correct temperature and will
always call for more cooling. Aside from your room ending up like a fridge,
this also increases the risk that the unit could overheat, because the
compressor never switches off as never detects the room is cold enough.



### Instructions for conversion after flow block test

If all machine requirements are met, you should once again read, be aware and
mitigate the risks mentioned in the red warnings box further up on this page.

Once aware of the risks, the steps to convert the unit from single hose to dual
hose are simple:

 1. Buy an additional fire alarm to have in the room with the AC. I'm not
    joking about this.
 1. Source an additional air conditioning hose or equivalent. This should be a
    similar diameter to the exhaust hose, so that flow rate is not restricted.
    It's also important it is sturdy and suitable for high temperatures, as
    this will be used partially outside in the sunlight on hot days.
 3. Create an adapter to duct the condenser (hot) air intake that you
    identified earlier, into the additional air conditioning hose, so that it
    draws air from the outside instead of inside. Make sure it's a good seal.
 4. Place the new hose through to the outside along with your exhaust hose
     * Ensure there is enough distance so that the hot air of the exhaust
        isn't being drawn straight into your new intake.
     * Secure the outside part of the intake hose. If left dangling, the
       suction could draw it onto close objects and block the flow. I found
       this out through experience, one day my intake hose had stuck itself to
       the outside wall like a limpit.


### How will I know if the conversion worked?
Place both hoses out of the window, ideally with some separation between them,
then turn the unit on. An AC window sealing kit is a worthwhile addition -
search for AC window sealing kit, they're about £20.

Close all of the doors and other windows, then do a quick feel with your hands
(or face) around the door frames. If you can't feel any air rushing in, then
you've ducted the right intake and there is no longer a pressure differential
in the room.

Then leave the room for at least an hour. Even if the conversion was
successful, a perfectly functioning AC will still take a while too cool a whole
room down due to the latent heat in all of the furniture and walls. After an
hour, the room should have started cooling down. After many hours, everything
in the room should be cool to the touch and feel like a fridge.


### Further tips for optimum efficiency

 * Purchase a window sealing unit designed for your type of window. They're
   only around £20, but make a big difference to the cooling performance, plus
   keep those summer bugs and flies outside.
 * Keep the intake and exhaust hoses away from each other when outside of the
   window. Having them close to each other increases the chance that the hot
   exhaust air is being drawn straight into the intake hose. If stacking
   vertically, I like to keep the intake hose below the exhaust hose for this
   reason too, as hot air rises slightly.
 * Keep the length of the hoses short, to minimise losses back into the room.
   Move the unit as close to the window as possible.

## Known working AC model conversion examples

### Challenge 5K (5,000 BTU)
This is the first air conditioner I modified. The unit was purchased in 2019
for £289.99 from Argos. Despite only being 5000 BTU, after conversion to dual
hose it was able to cool a medium sized room from 34 C outside temperatures
down to 22 C in only a couple of hours.

The conversion was performed in minutes, using items easily purchased at a
hardware shop or found around the house:

 1. An additional air conditioner hose bought from Amazon.
 2. An old clear tupperware box that was about the same size as the condenser
    intake port.
 3. Spare foam strips that came along with the air conditioner to provide a
    better seal between the box and the unit.
 3. Plenty of duck tape.

On the Challenge unit, the condenser air intake is the lower grille underneath
the exhaust hose port. After ducting this grille into the tumble drier hose,
this is the result. Not aesthetically pleasing, but very effective for the
three days of summer that the UK gets every year:

Originally, I acheived this using a polystyrene box, carboard and a tumble
drier hose. Whilst it worked fine, this wasn't the safest approach so next time
I used a proper air conditioning hose and a sturdy tupperware box:
