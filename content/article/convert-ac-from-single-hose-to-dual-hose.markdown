    Single hose air conditioners are ineffecient by design, but are the only
    portable type available to purchase in the UK. Convert them to dual hose
    for lower energy bills and drastically better cooling performance.

Single hose air conditioners (AC) should be banned. By design, they are
inefficient; they can blast cold air at a person sitting directly in front,
but will never be able to cool the rest of the room. Single hose ACs are bad
news for the environment, energy bills and your heatwave comfort!

The problem for UK residents is that single hose ACs are the only type of
portable model available to buy. Dual hose models, [window
units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning#Window_unit_and_packaged_terminal)
or portable split units are not available, despite their vastly superior
performance and efficiency. But what makes single hose ACs so bad?


## Background: Air conditioners are refrigerators with fans
Most air conditioning systems work by exchanging heat from the inside air to
the outside air, using [vapor-compression
refrigeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor-compression_refrigeration).
All efficient designs (anything that's not a single hose) do this without ever
mixing the separate air masses or causing any pressure differential between the
outside and inside. It doesn't matter whether it's a split AC unit in a
commercial property, the AC in your car, or your kitchen refrigerator, they
follow this operating model:

    )

</div>


Dual hose portable air conditioners follow the same principle, but incorporate
the outside unit into a single inside unit; instead using ducting hoses to draw
outside air over the condenser coils and back to the outside again. They are
more convenient as no permanent installation is required. They a tiny bit less
efficient due to heat loss through the hoses and the additional heat generated
from the compressor, which is now inside the room that needs to be cooled.

    )

## What makes single hose ACs so bad?
Single hose models are the only type that violate this principle, which is why
they are so inefficient. Instead of using two hoses to keep the air masses
separate and drawing outside air to pass over the condenser coils, they ditch
the intake hose and just draw the *inside* air instead — destroying the working
principles of air conditioning. Why? Probably because it's easier to market and
sell the convenience of one hose rather than two... They chose to leave out the
fine print that mentions going from two to one house makes a perfectly good
machine next to useless.

This single hose design has a huge performance cost. With the inside air now
being forced to the outside through the exhaust hose, the inside is now always
at a lower pressure.  No room is perfectly sealed, so to equalise the pressure,
hot air from outside is continuously drawn through door frames and a multitude
of other tiny gaps in the room. This is why single hose units will never cool
an entire room, they are constantly fighting against hot air rushing back into
the room due to the negative pressure.

Don't believe me? Turn the AC on in a small room, use a good seal between the
exhaust hose and the window, then close all doors and feel around the gaps
between the door and the frame. You'll be able to feel the air rushing in to
the equalise the negative pressure in the room you're trying to cool.


## Solution: Convert the single hose AC to dual hose
Thankfully, many single hose ACs can easily be converted to dual hose systems.
Single hose systems are often designed with two separate intake ports just like
dual hose units, despite only needing one; presumably to reduce design and
manufacturing costs. By fashioning an adapter to duct the condenser intake port
so that it draws from the outside air, it will perform with the same efficiency
as a dual hose unit.

### Will this work with my AC? The flow block test...
Every AC unit is different, so there are no guarantees this modification will
work with every model. As a guide, there are two major requirements that an AC
unit must meet to make conversion possible:

 1. The machine must have internal separation and air tight seals between the
    evaporator and condenser air flows.
 1. There must be two separate air intake ports, one for the evaporator
    (cold out) and one for the condenser (hot exhaust) air flow.

There's a quick way to check whether both requirements 1 and 2 are met, and
also establish which intake needs ducting — I call it the flow block test:

 1. Attach the exhaust hose and turn the unit on. Keep the hose inside the room
    with you.
 2. Using a sturdy but flexible item in one hand, such as a magazine or
    cardboard cutout (something strong enough to not get sucked in),
    temporarily block one of the air intakes while the machine is running.
    Don't do this for more than 2 seconds at a time, because you might burn the
    AC fan motor out with the extra stress.
 3. Use your other hand to check the flow rate changes as you block the intake.
    To pass the test, when the intake is blocked, both:
    1. The air flow rate out the **exhaust hose** must significantly
       **reduce**, or stop entirely.
    2. There must be **no change** or reduction to the flow rate of air exiting
       the **cold air output** grille.
 4. If both of those flow rate tests pass, then congratulations the machine
    can be converted, and you've just found the intake that needs ducting to
    the outside with an extra hose.

An additional minor requirement is that thermostat temperature probe must be on
the evaporator (cold) side air intake/flow also. This usually looks like a
small plumb bob dangling in front of the evaporator (cold) coil fins.  The
trouble comes if the probe is located in the condenser (hot) side air intake,
because once the intake is ducted it will no longer measure the room
temperature, it'll measure the outside air temperature. This means that the
unit can never tell when the room has reached the correct temperature and will
always call for more cooling. Aside from your room ending up like a fridge,
this also increases the risk that the unit could overheat, because the
compressor never switches off as never detects the room is cold enough.



### Instructions for conversion after flow block test

If all machine requirements are met, you should then be aware of the risks:

 * I'm not an expert on air conditioners, safety or anything related. You must
   be aware that you are following instructions from some random person on the
   internet that spent 20 minutes with cardboard, duck tape, trial, error and
   some luck.
 * This modification might increase the risk of the unit overheating,
   especially if modified incorrectly. It is easier for the ducted intake hose
   to become blocked or the flow rate impaired, compared to a wide open grille
   that was present before. See the note about an additional fire alarm in the
   instructions.
 * It will almost certainly invalidate any manufacturer warranty.
 * Materials used in the conversion must be able to withstand the same high
   temperatures as the exhaust hose, just in case they accidentally come in
   contact.

Once you're aware of the risks, the steps to convert the unit from single hose
to dual hose are simple:

 1. Buy an additional fire alarm to have in the room with the AC:
    1. It is likely the room with AC will have the doors closed. If you fall
       asleep and the machine malfunctions, it'll take seconds for the smoke to
       fill the room. With the doors closed, it's likely that you'll have
       already taken in too much smoke to wake up before it's able to reach the
       normal fire alarms outside the room you're in. Make sure you have on in
       the same room too.
 1. Source an additional air conditioning hose or equivalent. This should be a
    similar diameter to the exhaust hose, so that flow rate is not restricted.
 3. Create an adapter to duct the condenser (hot) air intake that you
    identified earlier, into the additional air conditioning hose, so that it
    draws air from the outside instead of inside. Make sure it's a good seal.


### How will I know if the conversion worked?
Place both hoses out of the window, ideally with some separation between them,
then turn the unit on. An AC window sealing kit is a worthwhile addition -
search for AC window sealing kit, they're about £20.

Close all of the doors and other windows, then do a quick feel with your hands
(or face) around the door frames. If you can't feel any air rushing in, then
you've ducted the right intake and there is no longer a pressure differential
in the room.

Then leave the room for at least an hour. Even if the conversion was
successful, a perfectly functioning AC will still take a while too cool a whole
room down due to the latent heat in all of the furniture and walls. After an
hour, the room should have started cooling down. After many hours, everything
in the room should be cool to the touch and it feel more like a fridge.


### Further tips for optimum efficiency

 * Purchase a window sealing unit designed for your type of window. They're
   only around £20, but make a big difference to the cooling performance, plus
   keep those summer bugs and flies outside.
 * Keep the intake and exhaust hoses away from each other when outside of the
   window. Having them close to each other increases the change that the intake
   hose is drawing in freshly exhausted hot air. If stacking vertically, I like
   to keep the intake hose below the exhaust hose for this reason too, as hot
   air rises slightly.
 * Keep the length of the hoses short, to minimise losses back into the room.
   Move the unit as close to the window as possible.


## Known working AC model conversion examples

### Challenge 5K (5,000 BTU)
Argos ID: 887/3600

This is the first air conditioner I ever modified.  I purchased this unit in
2019 for £289.99 from Argos. Despite only being 5000 BTU, after conversion to
dual hose it was able to cool a medium sized room from 34 C outside
temperatures down to 22 C in only a couple of hours.

The conversion was performed in minutes, using items easily purchased at a
hardware shop or found around the house:

 1. A tumble drier hose. This wasn't the same diameter as my exhaust hose, but
    it didn't restrict the air flow.
 2. An Amazon packaging box that was of similar size to the condenser intake
    port. This isn't the ideal material though, because it's not fire safe, nor
    water repellant.
 3. Spare foam strips that came along with the air conditioner to provide a
    better seal between the box and the unit.
 3. Plenty of duck tape.

This isn't an ideal set of materials, but works well enough to tide over for
the summer.

On the Challenge unit, the condenser air intake is the lower grille underneath
the exhaust hose port. After ducting this grille into the tumble drier hose,
this is the result. Not aesthetically pleasing, but very effective for the
three days of summer that the UK gets every year:
