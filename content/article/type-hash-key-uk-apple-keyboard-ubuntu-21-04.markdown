    If you're writing software using an Apple keyboard and Ubuntu, using the
    hash key will be inevitable. It took me an embarrassingly long time to
    figure this out.

### Step 1: Configure keyboard layout
Under Settings -> Language and Region -> Input Sources, ensure the only
configured input source is "English (UK, Macintosh)"

### Step 2: Learn to go right
To type a hash (#): *right-hand alt* + *3*.

I'm used to macOS, where the combination is *left-hand alt* + *3*. It took me
an embarrassingly long time to find out how to do this on Ubuntu.
